# Bioinformatic-Functions
Functions to perform fundamental bioinformatic tasks w/ Python

This repository contains functions to perform certain basic bioinformatic tasks in Python.

I acknowledge the fact that many of the tasks in this notebook can be completed via functions available in BioPython. However, I created this notebook in an effort to train my basic Python skills and tried to make minimal use of BioPython.

Most of the functions were inspired from or are solutions to problems on Rosalind platform (http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/)
